Conclusion： From the picture of wordcloud it can be seen that for most people, spending time with ‘friends’ and ‘family’ is joyful, enjoying a great ‘dinner’ or ‘trip’ also brings moments of happiness. Additionally, having a good ‘job’ or being part of a great ‘team’ is something that makes people happy.

From the picture of TF-IDF, it can be observed that what makes men and women happy differs. For example, men tend to prefer content and places like “gun” and “Wayanad” that can make them feel “furious,” while women prefer engaging in activities such as “knitting” and “crochet” as handicrafts.

From the picture of TF-IDF, it can be seen that people from different countries have different preferences for things they like. For example, Americans enjoy playing “baseball,” eating “donuts,” and drinking “Starbucks,” while Indians prefer wearing “saree” and earning “rupees.”

People with different marital statuses also have different definitions of happy moments. For example, married individuals may find happiness in being “pregnant” or spending time with their “spouse.” Meanwhile, single individuals may still be in “university,” so graduating or having a good “semester” can bring them happiness. Divorced individuals may prefer going to the “library” and enjoying their “Saturday” in their own way.

Next, when divide the population into whether they have become parents, it can be seen that for those who have become parents, spending time with their “grandchildren” in the “jungle” or playing “lacrosse” brings them happiness. On the other hand, for those who have not become parents, they prefer doing their own activities, such as exercising their “muscles” or having a meal of “roti.”

Finally, it can be observed from the picture of TF-IDFthat for middle-aged individuals, achieving financial independence in ‘finance’ or enjoying a meal of ‘roti’ with their ‘wife’ brings happiness. For elderly individuals, the happiest moments are still being together with their ‘grandchildren.’ As for young people, successfully completing their ‘homework’ and ‘exams’ through hard work brings them happiness.
