# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

'original_hm' and 'demographic' are data given by HappyDB

'clear_data' are data that have been cleaned

'stopwords' are stopwords that have been used in data-cleaning
